# ðŸ«• pcookbook 

This is a site im making for my partner and so I can document my recipes.

Im using [Luke Smith's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz) [website](based.cooking) as inspiration.
As stated before on luke smiths page, I hate when recipe websites are full of ads. In addition to that the current method of me storing my recipes isnt the greatest.

Im using in my website [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and Luke Smith's [theme](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo)

I might do submissions in the future but at the momment this is soley being ran by myself.
