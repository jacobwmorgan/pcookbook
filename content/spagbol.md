**THE BOL**

- ‚è≥ Prep : 25 - 30 mins
- üç≥ Cook time : 1 1/2 Hours - 6 hours
- üç≤ Serving : EVERYONE

This is a classic italian dish. Its really easy to make and is a great dish to make for a large group of people. Its also really easy to make a lot of it and freeze it for later. 

My mum does this dish the best. For the best results leave it for fucking AGES, I mean like 2-4 hours, maybe even all day. But dont forget to stir now and again and test the taste etc. Also dont set the heat too high if your leaving it on. Leaving it on could burn the bol and fuck your pan up majorly. Anyways time for grub !

(Note 1) Treat the mince like a ratio, 500g being the baseline of the entire recipe, if you have 750g use like 3 tins of tomatoes, you get the jist.


### Ingredients
- 500g of mince , beef mince (Refer to Note 1)
- 4 Rashes of Bacon
- 2 Tins of chopped tomatoes
- Tomatoe purae
- Beef/ chicken stock cube
- Olive Oil
- Fresh basil, 3/4 of a packet
- 1 Large Onion
- 2-3 cloves of garlic
- Any veg you wanna add
- Dried Rosmary
- Dried Oregano
- Dried Basil
- Dried Bay leaves
- Liquid , Wine or Water
- Wousester Sauce
- Spagetti
- Parmesan


### Method

1. Prepare the veg and chop all the bacon into little pieces, heat a large pot or pan with olive oil, 2 Tbsp should do

2. Place your bacon into the pan, keep moving the bacon around so it doesnt stick to the pan, dont worry about the bacon grime that will occur on the pan, this will add flavour later on.

3. Once the bacon is nice and golden brown, place the Onion, garlic and other veg into the pot, keep stiring and add some rosemary.

4. Once the onions start to sweat stick your mince in. Season the mince with salt and pepper and keep turning. Brown your mince all over and take a wiff of your creation

5. Once the mince is browned add the following
    - 2 Tbsp of tomatoe puree
    - 1 Stock cube
    - 2 Tins of chopped tomatoes
    - 1 Tbsp of Dried Oregano
    - 1 Tbsp of Dried Basil
    - Fresh Basil
    - Liquid
    - Four dashes of wouster sauce
    - 2 Bay leaves

6. This is the embreo of the bol, bring to a boil and crush all your tomatoes, stir it till it boils.

7. Place a lid on and turn the heat down to a simmer, leave it for 1 1/2 hours to 6 hours, stir it every now and again and taste it, add more seasoning if needed. It needs to be turned every 20 mins or so, dont let it burn.


8. When the bol starts to reduce and theres a red oil its [cheese time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dxi5NDDv3q0). Stick some parmesan in and stir it in, taste it and add more if needed.

9. Wait longer.

10. Once your happy with the taste, boil some water and cook your spagetti, once cooked, drain it and add it to the bol, mix it all together and serve with parmesan and fresh basil.
