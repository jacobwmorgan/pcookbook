This is a korean side dish, works really well with rice. You can leave it in the fridge and have it for the next day if you'd really like.

- ‚è≥ Prep : 5 mins
- üç≥ Cook time : 1 Hour
- üç≤ Serving : 8 People

### Ingredients
#### Main
- 1kg of Baby potatoes (just like use as many as youd like its not a big deal)
- 1 cup of water
- 2 Tbsp cooking oil (Veggie or Sunflower Oil)
- 2 Tbsp honey
- 1/2 Tbsp Seasme oil
- 1/2 Tbsp Seasame seeds

#### Braising Sauce
- 5 Tbsp Soy sauce
- 2 Tbsp Rice wine
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar

### Method
1. Rince your potatoes in warm water. Get rid of all the dirt and trim off any bruised areas. Chop them into a half if their bigger than a small egg.
2. Preheat a large (shallow) braising pot over medium high heat and add some oil. Make sure the bottom of it is covered in oil. Add the potatoes and drizzle them in oil.

Pan fry the potatoes over medium heat for around 25mins. Turn them around often to avoid burning. (Do it till their brownish. Usually this doenst take 25 mins. This is just to ensure their cooked)

Alternativley you can roast them in an oven at 200C for 30 mins. This is less hands on.


3. Once the outer layer is cooked and browned add the sauce and the water and bring to boil (For 2 mins). Reduce the heat and simmer until most of the sauce is boiled away (15 mins). Leave around 6 Tbsp of sauce.

Continue to simmer to get a darker colour and to make it stickeier.
