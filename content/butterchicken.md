This is the national dish of india, i think lol

Really easy and simple dish, you can serve this with [garlic rice](/garlicrice) or stick it in some tortillas and make a wrap. Stick some naan bread in the oven , this is gonna be mega tasty.

All the ingredients can be found cheaply in your local asian supermarket

- ‚è≥ Prep : 15 mins
- üç≥ Cook time : 30 mins
- üç≤ Serving : 2-6 People 

### Ingredients
#### Marinade
- 800g of boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts cut into little peieces, use as much as you want
- 1/2 cup of plain yoghurt
- 1 Tbsp of minced or grated ginger (Little tip, buy some pickled ginger if you cant be bothered)
- 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic
- 2 tsp of garam masala
- 1 tsp of turmeric
- 1 tsp of ground cumin
- 1 tsp of chilli powder 
- 1 tsp of salt

#### Sauce
Ok so either make this , or buy a jar of butter chicken sauce from the supermarket. I recommend making it though, its really easy and tastes better, im lazy af and barely make it tho lol

- 2 Tbsp of olive oil
- 2 Tbsp of butter or ghee
- 1 large onion finely chopped (or 2 small ones)
- 2 cloves of finely chopped garlic
- 1 Tbsp of minced or grated ginger
- 1 1/2 tsp of ground cumin
- 1 1/2 tsp of garam masala
- 1 tsp of ground coriander
- 400g of crushed tomotoes
- 1 tsp of chilli powder (if you want spicy, heres where you add it)
- 1 tsp of salt
- 1 cup of cream (heavy)
- 1 Tbsp of sugar
- 1/2 tsp kasoori methi / dried fenugreek leaves 

### Method

1. In a bowl, combine chicken with all of the ingredients for the chicken marinade; let marinate for 30 minutes to an hour (or overnight if time allows). Make sure the chicken is coated, get your hands messy.

2. Heat oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. When sizzling, add chicken pieces in batches of two or three, making sure not to crowd the pan. Fry until browned for only 3 minutes on each side. Set aside and keep warm. (You will finish cooking the chicken in the sauce.)

3. Heat butter or ghee in the same pan. Fry the onions until they start to sweat (about 6 minutes) while scraping up any browned bits stuck on the bottom of the pan.

4. Add garlic and ginger and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant, then add ground coriander, cumin and garam masala. Let cook for about 20 seconds until fragrant, while stirring occasionally.

5. Add crushed tomatoes, chilli powder (if using), and salt. Let simmer for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally until sauce thickens and becomes a deep brown red colour.

6. Remove from heat, scoop mixture into a blender and blend until smooth. You may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to 1/4 cup). Work in batches depending on the size of your blender.

7.  Pour the pur√©ed sauce back into the pan. Stir the cream, sugar and crushed kasoori methi (or fenugreek leaves) through the sauce. Add the chicken with juices back into the pan and cook for an additional 8-10 minutes until chicken is cooked through and the sauce is thick and bubbling.

8. Garnish with chopped coriander and serve with fresh, hot basmati rice or [garlic rice](/garlicrice) and some naan bread.
