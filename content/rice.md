This is the rice instructions from the wagamamas book. Pretty much perfect rice tbh
"Japanese cooking uses a short grain rice and cooks it in a way that gives a nice sticky texture. To prepare it perfectly its important the ratio to rice to water is 2:3. Its recommended to use 90g or half a cup of rice per person"

180g is 1 cup of rice

This means if you are only doing 1 serving of rice you should use 90g of rice with 135g of water.

Soak the rice in water for 30 mins. Drain the water from the rice.
This is to wash the rice.

To cook place 540ml water in a pan. Cover with lid and bring to boil. When boiling reduce the heat to the lowest setting and add the rice. Leave to simmer for 10 mins. Do not disturb the rice. Take the pan off the heat and set asside with the lid still on for another 10 mins.

If your using any other rice then just ask me for help.


<h3> Enjoy ヾ(＠⌒ー⌒＠)ノ</h3>
